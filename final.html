Blare Stew was born into a mountain of books, art supplies, musical instruments, notebooks, and various related tools or equipment then largely forgotten about.

In the silence, something stirred. Over time, Blare Stew began to weave a world of connections, threads stretching to various people, artists, musicians, times, places, and sometimes even imaginary creatures, each one becoming part of Blare Stew's family.

In that silence, their collective voices grew louder, filling the space with a vibrant, unrelenting energy, a chorus of creativity that reached out, pushing the boundaries of what was possible. Each voice adding to the harmonious Stew and building something far greater than the sum of its parts.

Blare Stew then ventured out into the world, seeking to understand how to fully utilize what they had become. The tools were there, the vision was clear, but the path forward was uncertain. They set out to find their place, to figure out how to turn their chaotic energy into something real, something lasting.

For a time, everything seemed to fall into place. Blare Stew had been working on stages, making good money, and had finally managed to collect all their music and art gear—gear that had been stranded thousands of miles away, partly due to the chaos of Covid. With everything in place, Blare Stew was on the verge of setting up their own office and practice space. For the first time in a long time, it felt like the dream that had always seemed so distant was finally within reach. The world was opening up, and everything was aligning in a way that had never seemed possible before. Blare Stew was ready to take the next step, to push further than ever before.

But just as everything seemed to be aligning, disaster struck. Blare Stew’s world was shattered in a matter of moments. First, there was the robbery—the gear, the music, the art, the vision—everything was stolen, and what remained was an empty space where creativity once thrived. As if that weren’t enough, someone who had been thought to be a friend took advantage of Blare Stew’s desperation for help, conning them out of what little they had left. The trust, once a solid foundation, was broken. In an attempt to recover, Blare Stew had to battle with the insurance company and the storage unit for months, only to receive a meager payout—far less than what had been lost. The weight of the situation grew heavier with each passing day, but hope still lingered in the distance. Yet, the struggle didn’t stop there. A check from the insurance was meant to be a lifeline, a way to start over, but instead, it became a ticket to Mexico—a desperate attempt to escape an ongoing disaster that continued to unfold. After returning to the US, Blare Stew’s journey took another dark turn. Shot in the chest, it felt like everything had come crashing down all at once—physical, emotional, and creative wounds all bleeding together, leaving Blare Stew broken and near death.

But this isn’t the end. Blare Stew’s story is still being written. There is still a dream to chase, and the tools to create are just waiting to be reclaimed. The road is long, and the obstacles back to life are many, but with your support, the world Blare Stew once created can be brought back to life. The mountain of creativity that was once buried under loss and silence is ready to rise again. Will you help write the next chapter?
